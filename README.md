# jsfft-gpu
 Trying to translate jsfft for gpujs, it's confusing. Working very simplistic DFT example using series notation, plus a hacky but ultra fast FFT compared to jsfft, just increase the seconds of simulated data to show how the GPU performance stays fairly stable while CPU time skyrockets for the DFT example, but there are a lot of optimizations possible I will be trying. Check the console for timer results.
